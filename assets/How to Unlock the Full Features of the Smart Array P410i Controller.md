Fortunately, there is a solution that involves using an evaluation license key that was originally provided by HP for testing purposes. This license key is valid for 60 days, but it can be extended indefinitely by changing the system date before installing it. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of the Smart Array Advanced Pack v.1.0 without paying anything.
 
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the latest firmware and drivers for your controller from [HPE Support](https://support.hpe.com/connect/s/product?language=en_US&ismnp=0&l5oid=3883890&kmpmoid=3883933&tab=driversAndSoftware&cep=on&driversAndSoftwareFilter=8000113&driversAndSoftwareSubtype=9000214).
2. Install the firmware and drivers on your server.
3. Reboot your server and enter the BIOS setup.
4. Change the system date to a future date, such as 60 years ahead.
5. Save and exit the BIOS setup.
6. Boot into your operating system and launch the Smart Array Configuration Utility (ACU) or the Smart Storage Administrator (SSA) tool.
7. Select your controller and click on License Management.
8. Enter the following evaluation license key: `34T62-N84MB-7DQGY-G7XGT-YTQ63`.
9. Click on Apply License Key and confirm.
